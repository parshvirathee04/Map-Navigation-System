# map-navigation-system

A simple map navigation system using C++ and C graphics.

The project consists of a small predefined map of nodes built using C graphics. These nodes act as source and destination points for the user. 
Let's have a look at the user experience:
1. The user can select either a cab or a bus transport service. 
2. The user is asked to input the source and destination node respectively for the service chosen.
3. The program generates the shortest path between the selected source and destination node and the respective shortest path is shown to user by highlighting it on the map.

The project is based on dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes. 

HOW TO RUN:  
Codeblocks IDE was used to run this project. It already has C++ support but C graphics library needs to be added and set up additionally.
